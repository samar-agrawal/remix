## Invite
Using Geographical co-ordinates get a list of eligible attendes.

### Problem

We have some customer records in a text file -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our office (GPS coordinates 53.3381985, -6.2592576) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by user id (ascending).
